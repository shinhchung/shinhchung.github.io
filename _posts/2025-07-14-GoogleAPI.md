On Sunday, I tried to use WebIO with the Google API because my local cloud server was too slow. That's why I am exploring Google API or something like the ChatGPT API, but I don't want to spend money on APIs. When I tried using the Google API, I encountered usage limits. Is this because I am using the free tier? I'm not sure, and I still haven't fixed it. I need more time to resolve this issue.https://res.cloudinary.com/dy3kvumqo/image/upload/v1752645449/wojak_mcdonald%E5%90%89%E5%8D%9C%E5%8A%9B_gtjliw.png
