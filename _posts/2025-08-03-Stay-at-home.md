I stayed at home all week with nothing much to do. I just updated my cloud server and took some notes. I wanted to try creating daily news, but I noticed there are already AIs doing that. So, I changed my mind. I should do something else, like improving my WebIO website. Iâ€™m still trying to come up with a new idea before my long vacation.
