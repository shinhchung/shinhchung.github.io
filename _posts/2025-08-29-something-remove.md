I finally had my wisdom tooth removed. The doctor said my tooth are not in good condition because they have been inflamed many times. My tooth had fused with the bone, so the doctor could only remove the crown and leave the root inside. There is a chance my body might treat the root as a foreign object and push it out, but hopefully nothing happens. I just hope it stays in my mouth and doesn’t cause any problems. This time, only one tooth was removed. Next Thursday, I will have another one taken out. I hope everything goes smoothly. I really don’t want any more strange
